# FindYourKs
This repository provides a generalizable and minimal Python-based framework for fitting kinetic models to experimental time-course data. In the notebook (FindYourKs.ipynb), a four step reaction is reported, namely the deamidation of asparagine (Asn) to form succinimide (Suc) and aspartate (Asp). \\
The required files for reproducing our results are also provided.
